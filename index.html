		<p class="p1">(Bengali: বগুড়া), officially Bogura, is a city located in Bogra District, Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh. Bogura is also called the capital of Northern Bangladesh. <br>The city is a major commercial hub in Northern Bangladesh. It is the second largest city in terms of both area and population in Rajshahi Division.</p>
		<h2 style="background-color:#FFDBB6; text-align:center; color:#5D688A">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="p2">Bogra is considered the oldest city of Bengal, dating to the reign of the Great Emperor Ashoka, who ruled India from 268 to 232 BCE. When Ashoka conquered the Bengal (Bongo) region, he founded Bogra and called it Pundra Bardhan. This is supported by the discovery in October 2008 of an ancient engraved stone believed to be produced in the Gupta era near Sura Mosque at Ghoraghat Upazila in Dinajpur.</p>
		<h3 class="p3" style="background-color:#FFDBB6; text-align:center; color:#5D688A">Tourism</h3>
		<p>Near Bogra is Mahasthangarh, the earliest known urban archaeological site in Bangladesh, as well as the village of Mahasthan in Shibganj thana of Bogra District. This site contains the remains of Pundranagara (or Paundravardhanapura), an ancient city in the territory of Pundravardhana. This place is considered sacred to Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus alike.</p>
